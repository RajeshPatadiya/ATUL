Brief:
Setting up site, make sure IIS 7 is used, and Rewrite plugin is installed.  Document root is 
Atul/public folder -- not Atul root folder.  Rewrite rules are included in source in web.config,
so defining those in the IIS settings should not be necessary.  If you need to manually to 
set those up, however, simply redirect all (non-existing file) calls to Atul/public/index.php. 

Site architecture uses Zend framework, taking advantage of url rewriting and new PHP
version features.  Use controller name to organize and separate files. (/css/admin/file.css)

Auth using Ldap, caching via Wincache or APC, User and Utility classes commonly used.  View 
helpers are now under /application/views/helpers.

We have a docs folder for storing standard documentation for site setup and complicated procedures, 
as well as tests folder for storing unit tests to be run using PHPUnit (will need further 
bootstrapping for unit testing).

All data and information calls (except for initial User lookup) are piped through API.
